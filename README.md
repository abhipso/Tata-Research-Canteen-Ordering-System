#Tata-Research-Canteen-Ordering-System
Here is my winning submission at WebD 2016, organised by IIEST Shibpur. Participants from all over the country takes part in this event.
This is a team event with maximum number of members 2. However I participated as a single member team.


# Problem Statement

The construction of Tata Research Canteen has recently been completed at IIEST. The canteen has decided to experiment on providing an electronic reception system where one can submit their order and collect it after some time from the counter. For this experiment, few students have been chosen by the institute.


The Compulsary Requirements-

1. Create a login page. You will be provided with users.json containing the userid, username and md5 hashed passwords of the students selected for the experiment. Registration page is not required as no new students will be allowed to register.

2. Create an index page which will display the menu items available in the canteen. For this you will be provided with the menu.json file containing the itemId, item, category, pricePerItem of the menu items.

3. The user should also be able to search items according to category (provided in menu.json).

4. The page should also display the price of the items and allow the user to order maximum quantity of 10 for any item.

5. Use HTML Local Storage or HTML Session Storage to store the item and quantity of each item ordered.

6. Do not use any database to store the user data.

7. Have a user section or “Your Order” section where the user can view, decrease the quantity or cancel the items that he/she 
has ordered till then.

8. Once a user has finished ordering, he would click the “Order Now” button and would be redirected to the confirmation page where a summary of the user’s order would be shown and the user will click “Confirm”. 

9. The page should also contain a “Go Back” button to allow user to change his order, if required.

10. The user will then be redirected to the home page or a separate page where the message “Collect your order from the counter after some time” and will be provided the order number. 

11. Once a user logs out, this information should be automatically deleted from local storage.


Bonus points will be given to-

1. Better security for login and json fetching.

2. Better presentation of the website.

3. Responsive Website.
